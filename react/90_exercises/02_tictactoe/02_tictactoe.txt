Tic tac toe

Create tic tac toe game on 3x3 grid. Players alternate between 'X' and 'O' 
and player wins if he/she/it gets three in straight line horizontally, diagonally
or vertically. You can use multiple different ways of creating the grid but making
each grid member a component is probably the easiest way. After each round check for winners


Bonus: create an "AI" (random) player.
